# MLND-CAPSTONE - Right Whales Detection

## Description
This project is the capstone project in Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. The goal is to detect and identify right whales.

## Software Requirements
- Python 2.7
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit Learn
- Keras over TensorFlow
- Open CV2

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to automatically install some of the required packages.

## Setup
Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition/data) and add the images to the project folder under `MLND-CAPSTONE/imgs`.
To apply image cropping in the preprocessing step, create a new directory ad follows `MLND-CAPSTONE/imgs/cropped` and run the cropping code cells in the notebook.
After cropping is done, move the cropped folder to the root as follows `MLND-CAPSTONE/cropped`. Cropping [code reference](https://github.com/eduardofv/whale_detector/).
To build the model, execute the cells in the iPython notebook `Capstone - Right Whales-second model.ipynb`.
